# Usage
## Managing your company's GitHub Organization
### Repositories
The file `src/aws_central_infrastructure/github_repos/repos.py` contains a list of repositories that are managed by this project. To add a new repository, add a new entry to the `configs` list. You'll also likely want to grant at least one Team some permissions to use this new repository (see section below on Teams).

If you want to allow many people to contribute via `push` access, but still gate Pull Requests with approvals from a smaller subset of people, you can create a CODEOWNERS file within your repository to distinguish which Teams have the ability to approve Pull Requests.

### Teams
The file `src/aws_central_infrastructure/github_repos/teams.py` contains a list of teams that are managed by this project. To add a new team, add a new entry to the `configs` list.
Ensure to assign it appropriate permissions (typically `push`...sometimes referred to as `write` in other contexts) for the repositories it needs access to.
Teams can have a parent, from which they inherit permissions. This is useful for creating a hierarchy of teams.
If an explicit parent is not provided in the configuration, the team will have the root `Everyone` team as its parent.

You can grant a Team permissions for a repository even if that repository was not created using this process.

### External Collaborators
The file `src/aws_central_infrastructure/github_repos/collaborators.py` contains a list of external collaborators that are managed by this project. To add a new collaborator, add a new entry to the `configs` list.
Ensure to assign them appropriate permissions (typically `push`...sometimes referred to as `write` in other contexts) for the repositories they needs access to.

You can grant a Collaborator permissions for a repository even if that repository was not created using this process.

### Initial configuration for Github organization
It's recommended to set the following permissions for the Organization to guide people towards doing more things via this repository instead of the Console.

* Base Permissions: Read
* Repository Creation: Neither
* Pages Creation: Neither
* Allow members to create teams: No

## Allowing a git repository to publish a package to AWS CodeArtifact
The file `src/aws_central_infrastructure/artifact_stores/internal_packages.py` contains a list of repositories that are allowed to publish packages to the AWS CodeArtifact registry. To enable a new repository to do so, add a new entry to the `repo_package_claims` list. This ensures that only one git repo has permission to publish that package, and there's no conflicts of two repos overwriting each other's packages.
At the moment, only Python packages are supported. See https://github.com/LabAutomationAndScreening/copier-aws-central-infrastructure/issues/22 and https://github.com/LabAutomationAndScreening/copier-aws-central-infrastructure/issues/21

## Allowing a git repository to publish a docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry
The file `src/aws_central_infrastructure/artifact_stores/container_registries.py` contains a list of repositories that are allowed to publish images to an AWS ECR. To create a new ECR that a repository can publish to, add a new entry to the `container_registries` list. This ensures that only one git repo has permission to publish to that ECR, and there's no conflicts of two repos overwriting each other's images.
